# NAND-networks
My Part II Project
TODO:

embed the smaller adders
pooling
fix convolution

potentially include other gates for better optimisation
measure loss curves, and training times.
include logging of losses and training times
embedding learnt circuits into bigger domains
optax chaining gradient transforms, masking, can optimise different parts of the network differently - could have a lower learning rate for original connections, higher for new ones.
temporal l2 coefficient increasing.

value consistency - don't stop when you find a solution, see how consistent certain parameters are at getting solutions.meeting with Rob - slides/presentation
