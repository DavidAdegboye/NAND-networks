# NAND-networks

 In this project, I invent, develop, and evaluate “NAND networks” — a method for
 automating combinational logic circuit synthesis with machine learning (ML). This project
 is motivated by applications in Tiny Machine Learning (TinyML) and combinational
 logic circuit synthesis. Evaluation is integrated throughout, with the results from NAND
 networks evaluated against the state-of-the-art (SOTA) in both domains.

The code for my Cambridge University Part II Project, which was graded first class. The structure of the repository is explained in Section 3.1 of the dissertation.
